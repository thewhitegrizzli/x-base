# x-base
x-base is a custom css framework to build on when developing custom websites.

You could call it bootstrap-like but way more flexible and leaner. 

I developed it for my own needs starting 2020 with a view to keep the classes simple, lean and stackable, working together rather than one class per desired output or style.
